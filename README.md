# SchausPopDynamics
Repository for code and data to reproduce population dynamic analyses and figures associated with Steele Cabrera et al. manuscript. Mark-recapture data is not released, so population estimates are not reproducible. However, we do release an example script documenting the code used to generate year-specific populatione estimates.

## data
Sub-directories holding the data to reproduce Figure 2, 3, and 4, along with the data to reproduce the population dynamics and forewing size models. 

  - forewingSize: stores data on measured Schaus swallowtail forewings.
  - populationEstimates: provides estimates of population size per year resulting from our MRR model.
  - weatherData: stores data on weather predictor variables used in analyses. 

## scripts
Sub-directories of the analysis and figure scripts used in associated mansucript. 

  - analysis: scripts used to model and produce figures related to population dynamics and forewing size.
  - figure: script used to generate Figure 2, displaying population estimates through time, along with yearly-weather data.
